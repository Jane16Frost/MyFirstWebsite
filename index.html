        <p>
          I really enjoy certain things. I definitely enjoy some things more than others!
          My favourite hobby is great, and I also like some foods. Growing up, I was always
          fond of my favourite activities. Plus, I really like some styles of music!
          People that know me would definitely confirm that these facts are true!
          That's really all there is to say.
          <br>
          I have a lot of hobbies including coding like this shitty looking website. Art which I'm actually good at.
          And a few new things like, parkour, ice skating and annoying my friends.
